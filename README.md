<h2>LET'S MAKE THE MOST "STUPIDLY", "REDUNDANT", ROBUST, VERSATILE, ACCESSIBLE AND PORTABLE PHP IMAGE UPLOAD SCRIPT</h1>

### SOME EXPLANATION
- **ROBUST:**  
    As secure as possible. Perhaps with a lot of redundancies  
    
- **VERSATILE:**  
    Can have redundancies to make it secure but performance should not be sacrificed.  
    
- **ACCESSIBLE:**  
    This script should be easily accessible to new and experienced programmers alike.  
    Particularly, error messages must be very expressive and "human friendly"
    
- **PORTABLE:**  
    The script should easily fit into any project environment.
